# NetworkProgramming
<p>This is the first time that I deal with the README of my programe in English, so mistakes are inevitable, please read with patience and tolerance.And as I thought out and wrote this message simultaneously, complex languang structure will not be adopted!Tnanks.</p>

<h3>> the following content consists of three major parts:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>the design and art work:  <i>brief description of the design of the webpages</i></li>
  <li>the front desk:  <i>the major part, detailed information</i></li>
  <li>the end desk:  <i>nodejs - express</i></li>  
 </ul>


<h4>> PART1: Design</h4>

<p>this is the finished edition of the design, and what's up there is where the downloaded img exists, it uses <b>'float' with a fixed 200px width</b> to achieve the waterfall layout, in that box, detailed information with <b>CSS animations added</b>, the name of the img and author is showed all the time and <b>'hover'</b> will trigger the animation and other messages appears: tags and likes as well as the major color of the image</p>

<p>As for this part, obviously, it is the <b>upload component</b> of the website, I use the <b>design pattern of 'bilibili' for reference</b>, so it might looks alike, but, not the same, for the use of clipping function, the container must be big enough to hold the entire image, by the way, and add btn will notice the programe to add a new box, the the box itself will <b>be destoryed after the message is sent</b> to the server successfully<p>

<h4>> PART2: Front desk</h4>
